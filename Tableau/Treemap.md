For more types of charts, visual examples, tips, and information, download our whitepaper. In this paper, you’ll learn about different chart (and graph) 
types—from bar charts to density maps to box-and-whisker plots. 
You'll also learn when to use one chart over another, along with tips on how to leverage these chart types for maximum impact.
