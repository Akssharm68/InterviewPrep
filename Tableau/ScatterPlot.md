Scatter plots are an effective way to investigate the relationship between different variables, showing if one variable is a good predictor of another,
or if they tend to change independently. A scatter plot presents lots of distinct data points on a single chart. 
The chart can then be enhanced with analytics like cluster analysis or trend lines.
