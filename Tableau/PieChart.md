Pie charts are powerful for adding detail to other visualizations. Alone, a pie chart doesnâ€™t give the viewer a way to quickly and accurately compare information.
Since the viewer has to create context on their own, key points from your data are missed. Instead of making a pie chart the focus of your dashboard, 
try using them to drill down on other visualizations.
