3.What is Meant by ‘discrete’ and ‘continuous’ in Tableau?
  Tableau represents data depending on whether the field is discrete (blue) or continuous (green).
    Discrete - "individually separate and distinct."
    Continuous - "forming an unbroken whole without interruption."

4. What Are the Filters? Name the Different Filters in Tableau.
  This is one of the most frequently Tableau interview questions. And you must try giving a thorough answer to this one! 
  Tableau filters are a way of restricting the content of the data that may enter a Tableau workbook, dashboard, or view. 
  
  The Different Types of Tableau Filters are:
   Extract filters
   Context filters
  Data source filters
  Filters on measures
  Filters on dimensions
  Table calculation filter
  
  
5. What is the Difference Between Joining and Blending?
   Combining the data from two or more different sources is data blending such as Oracle, Excel, and SQL Server.
   In data blending, each data source contains its own set of dimensions and measures. 
   Combining the data between two or more tables or sheets within the same data source is data joining. 
   All the combined tables or sheets contain a common set of dimensions and measures.
   
   
6. Which Visualization Will Be Used in the given Scenarios?
  
  To show aggregated sales totals across a range of product categories and subcategories
  To show the duration of events or activities 
  To show quarter wise profit growth 
  We would use the following visualizations for the given scenarios:
  Treemap
  Gantt chart
  Waterfall chart   
  
7. How Do You Handle Null and Other Special Values?
  If the field contains null values or if there are zeros or negative values on a logarithmic axis, Tableau cannot plot them. 
  Tableau displays an indicator in the lower right corner of the view, and you can click the indicator and choose from the following options:
        Filter Data
        Excludes the null values from the visualization using a filter. In that case, the null values are also excluded from any calculations used in the view.
        Show Data at Default Position
        Shows the data at a default location on the axis.
